# ðŸ©º HealHub â€“ Streamlit Cloud Deployment

This repository contains the **Streamlit Cloud deployment** of **HealHub**, a voice-enabled healthcare assistant built as part of the **DA2250 (Summer 2025)** project at **IISc Bangalore**.

HealHub helps users interact through voice or text to receive basic healthcare guidance in a conversational format.

## ðŸ“¦ About This Repository

Since Streamlit Cloud requires repository ownership for deployment, this version was created separately for hosting purposes.


The full development and collaboration happened in the [original team repository](https://github.com/rootbid/HealHub).
